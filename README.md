# QRcodeGen

This is a qr code generator that I worked on for the company TA98. The reason behind it was because I was asked to see how to save the company money, and of the possible solutions was to cut the expenses that was going towards services to make qr codes for the events. 

I was influenced on making this qr code generator by w3schools and youtube videos that I saw online that involved making qr code generators using python.
